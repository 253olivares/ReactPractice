# React movie site application

This is a react module follow along with the resource of Javascript Mastery.

For this module we are creating a movie site in react. For our data we utilize an api server omdb databse. This returns a large category of movies and information attached to those movies. Every time data changes in our search movie input field we run a function that sends our input to the api and return any results if any our found. If they are we display that data using map sending each movie data in our movie card component.
