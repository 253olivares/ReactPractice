# React Stop Watch

React module to create a stop watch it begins by creating states that will keep track of our stop watch current state. If its running or not and when we click start we create a interval that keeps track of elapsed time and converts it into readable time that then is set to our elapsed time causing dom to rerender. When dom rerenders we show new elapsed time calculated previously.
