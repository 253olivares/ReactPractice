# React Update Array practice

In this module we practice using the set function provided to us in react states to update our state values. We use an input field to create a new object and append it to our array using the set function. As well us an double click event listener to remove objects from the array based on index.

React keeps track of changes to the state and rerenders our page to reflect any update to our state.
