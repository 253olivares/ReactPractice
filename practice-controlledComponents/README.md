# React Controlled Components Practice

React practice module to practice form submission. In this module I am practicing creating my own form controlled component. This means creating a form component where data entry is reliant on state management vs dom management for our data.

EX: storing our form data in state (setState(input.value)) vs grabbing our dom data (getelmentbyid(#id).value) on submit.
