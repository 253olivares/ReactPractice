# React Todo List 3 (Typescript practice)

This is another todo list by this time we are utilizing some third part libraries and practicing some advance state management using reducers. Our reducer keeps track of our todo state that is our input field at the top and two additional todos arrays that are used to manage our lists. The user can then interact with each todo to make it as finished or delete as well as edit. The user also has the ability to click on the todo and drag it between boxes to place it in complete or todo list. Depending on the box the user drags into our app will update the todo to reflect such state such as change its done state.

This module is being used to practice using and learning typescript.

The following is the video created to set up the basic for this project:

In addition to following along I added some features to enhance the user experience such as cleaning some bugs, app update done state based on the table its in, transfer all states to use a reducer that way the page reloads less and completes more changes as well as make it clear to the user when they can and can not edit todos.
