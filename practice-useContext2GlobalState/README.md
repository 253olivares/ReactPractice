# React useContext Practice

This module is a copy of our previous useContext practice with th only difference being me texting our component to check see if wrapping our app in useContext we can create global states that doesnt rely on us only issuing it in child components that other child components.

Doing it this way we can create a main state manager file that avoids placing states is separate segments of the page that makes it difficult of keep track or managing.
