# React UseContext Global State

This practice is the same as our useContext practice only difference for this one we are focused on using useContext and turning it into a global state. There are alot of benefits from creating global states vs initializing then within their component.

First being the fact that global states dont require the use of prop drilling to move data down a dom tree. We can just fetch where needed by calling the required documents.

Easier to locate and manage. In larger projects where we have hundreds of files it can get hard to manage where states are.
