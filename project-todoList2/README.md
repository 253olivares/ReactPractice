# React TodoList 2

Another react practice todo module further studying React fundamentals to build a todo app.

This todo app further expands on some previous practices and utilizes routes, useContext, fetchApi(only when using the fake backend otherwise if it doesnt recognize it the app utilizes users local storage to save data), useEffects are also used to load our data at the start and then use layout is used to push our task into the local storage when our server isnt connect (more information on this choice in provider jsx comments)
