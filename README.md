# Repository collection for my progress in react.
Each application section is separated per folder. If you wish you view and run any of the contents download the respective folder and run the following scripts

1. Command Line: npm install (to install all necessary dependencies)
2. Command Line: npm run dev (to run a host of the project)

## File structure

Each folder is annotated with either practice or project to identify their scope
Practices will usually be smaller coding practices that I use/create to understand react concepts. 
Projects: Larger projects that combine a lot of the practices I have learned
