# React Suspense Component

For this module I will be taking the application created for the skeleton component module and transferring it over to utilize react suspense. Our previous application utilizes SWR built in features to handing loading and error handling. This method however is reliant on conditional statements abd causes our code to become overly complicated and difficult to read.

For this reason we are reformating our application to short and make our application more legible.

Tutorial utilized for this test provided below.
