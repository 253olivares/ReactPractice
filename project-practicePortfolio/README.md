# React practice portfolio site

This is a react site that I created to practice site building. Nearing the end of my react journey I am at a stage where I feel comfortable with a lot of the react idealogies and fundamentals. I created this site following this guide.

Using a lot of features and practices leaned here I plan on creating my own react portfolio but not copying what was done here.
Recreating project like these I find are the best way to learn to code and understand how code functions.
