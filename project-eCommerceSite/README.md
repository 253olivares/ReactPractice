# React Ecommerce practice site

This is a small React project focused on creating a light Ecommerce site. The application it self is very bare bone and doesn't actually let people check out. All its intended to do is create an application that lets you browse shopping items and add them to cart. We have a state that keeps track of shopping cart items and a state that keeps track on inventory. The cart state updates when we add or remove items from our cart.
