# React Tic Tac Toe Project

This is a practice module to build a tic tac toe game using react and javascript logic. This is a followed module using reacts guide on react.dev site where we follow to deepen our basic understanding of react state and components

In addition to completing the module I went again and did some of the challenges at the bottom of the module to expand features of the game.
We further dive into react userefs and reforwads to complete some of these challenges and add additional game logic to our react project
