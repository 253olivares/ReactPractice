# REACT Journey Repository

This is my main React repository where I upload frequently any coding practices for my React Journey.

I began my framework journey at the beginning of 2024 

I left my previous job position and returned to my field of study. To do this I had to study new up to date coding frameworks. After graduating college in 2022 I felt like my web development knowledge was lacking leading me to leave the area of study for a while. 

Now back I have begun studying Vue js and React js. This repository will be dedicated to documenting my React journey. You can view each document folder to view my progression and coding knowledge.

### Coding Sources

The primary sources I utilize to learn React are React documentation on the official page and several React YouTube videos. Some of which I will provide below. Document by document I will record my sources for each module when I can. 

[Official React Website](https://react.dev/ "Official React Website")

[PedroTech Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlvBzyy-558 "PedroTech Videos")

[Bro Code React JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgkZ7MvWUAA&t=2s "Bro Code React JS")

[React JS Tutorial - Basic to Advance (2023)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd3P3yXyx30 "React JS Tutorial - Basic to Advance (2023)")

By far the best method I have found to learn any coding languages to by utilizing online resources and following allong tutorials. Seeing the coding transform and your code and change it does wonders for learning. 

## File Structure

Each folder is annotated with either practice or project to identify their scope
Practices will usually be smaller coding practices that I use/create to understand react concepts.

Projects: Larger projects that combine a lot of the practices I have learned

Each folder may have its readme and comments in the code documenting my programming progression.

Thank you so much for your time for reading!
