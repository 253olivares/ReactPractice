# React useEffect Hook Practice

This module practices using the useEffect hook which is functions to create blocks of codes that are run whenever the framework detects changes in a state. This is different from on change as on change only changes to input changes from the user. Useeffect works around state changes in the life cycle.

UseEffect can create large scale changes whenever our state changes. We can only set it to update when only specific state states change which I practice in my second useEffect module.
