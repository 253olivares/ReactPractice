# REACT Portfolio Site (Practice Site)

This is a REACT site that I created to practice site building. Nearing the end of my react journey I am at a stage where I feel comfortable with a lot of the react idealogies and fundamentals.

Site was created following the guide provided below:

[React Project Tutorial – Build a Portfolio Website w/ Advanced Animations](React Project Tutorial – Build a Portfolio Website w/ Advanced Animations)

Using a lot of features and practices leaned here I plan on creating my own react portfolio but not copying what was done here.

Recreating project like these I find are the best way to learn to code and understand how code functions.
