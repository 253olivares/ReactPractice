# React useMemo Practice

React useMemo is react hook that helps prevent data from repeating. This is done by cache results to prevent calculations between re-renders

On smaller projects this may not be necessary but on large scale projects this a very valuable resource to save on performance.

usMemo is called at the very top of the function and you can set a dependency so it recalculates only when it has determined the data has changed.
