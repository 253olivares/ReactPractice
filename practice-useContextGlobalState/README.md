# React UseContext Global State

In this module I practice setting us globals states using useContext. useContext allows us to create state files that control our applications back end processes. Utilizing global states processes allows us to store and modify data without needing to prop drill.

In smaller projects this may not be a issues but on larger scale projects it is beneficial to store all our api functions in one folder instead of multiple folder between multiple components
