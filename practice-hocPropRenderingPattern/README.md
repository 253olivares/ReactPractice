# React High Order Component Render Props

This module further expands on High Order Component Rendering (HOC).

Prop rendering is an alternative method of HOC that allows use to inject rendering templates and states into the component.

This is very different from the original method of creating new components bu cloning them.

Both methods meet a the same resolution and allows us to share sates and functions with the flexibility of changing special values data source and data display.
