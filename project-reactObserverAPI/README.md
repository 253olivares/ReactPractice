# React Observer API

For this module we are going to practice utilizing react observer API. This API will allows us to infinitely load content into our application as the user scrolls down. This is a really good skill to know as most application are developed with the intention to allow the user to infinitely scroll to engage in content. This allows us to avoid needing to use pagination and provides a engaging user experience.
