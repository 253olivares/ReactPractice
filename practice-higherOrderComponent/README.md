# React High Order Component Practice

High Order Component Component (HOC) is a advance react coding technique that allows us to cute reuse code saving us on performance and readability.

Ideal use cases for this situation are those where repeat components use the same state and functions where the only difference is data source or date.

EX: Data Endpoints and servers

Using HOC we create a function that creates a new component based on pre existing components.

Creating a dynamic component we change the data states and sources through props.
