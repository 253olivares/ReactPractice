# React Use Layout Effect

This module I cover and learn the difference between uselayouteffect and useeffect. Both of these are react functions that server the same purpose and function similarly with the only difference being the phase in the lifecycle which both these functions trigger. UseLayoutEffect will always trigger before useEffect as it is run before a component is rendered while useeffect runs after a component is rendered.
